# ESP32-S3_SEN66_Sensor
ESP32-S3 Indoor Air Quality Sensor using the Sensirion SEN66

This project code was inspired by Volos Projects: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E4jF15imr6k and has been modified to use the Sensirion SEN66 that measures 	
Carbon Dioxide (CO2), Humidity, NOx, Particulate Matter, Temperature, VOC Sensor I2C all over and i2c Qwiic bus. The ESP32-C6 board used in this image is a custom one that I design here: https://github.com/mike-rankin/ESP32-S3_1.69inch_Cap_Touch but anything will do like the various ESP32-S3 or C6 ones from WaveShare.
